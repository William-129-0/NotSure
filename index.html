There was once a mad scientist who lived on mount everest. He was famous for making new animals. Everyone feared him. They didn't want to be part of his creations. He created  the baboon (made a monkey sit on fire for 1 hour), the snake (cut off a reptile’s limbs and put it in a stretching machine) and many more. This is the story of the narwhal.
It has been a long time since Zinker, the mad scientist, made a new animal. Every creation for the last few years failed. His latest successful creation is his pet gat (goat and cat) named Zuper. Zinker was thinking “What animal should I make? If I don’t make a new animal soon, then my reputation will fall to pieces.He poundered for hours, like always. “OH! I GOT IT!” he shouted, “I’ll mix a unicorn and a whale together!
“Meow Meow” Zuper agreed.
It was a fantastic idea. But he must travel to Lunk sea to get the right whale, then travel to Uniland to get the almost extinct unicorn. So Zinker packed up all the necessary supplies and set off.
“PU!” the mad scientist exclaimed! “This place smells like whale poop!”
“Stop criticizing the smell of our poop!” argued a whale, “I bet your poop smells even worse. You guys eat more disgusting food than us, did you know that-
“ENOUGH!” Zinker broke in. “Please go away, you're giving me a headache.”
“Okey doke!” replied the whale. Then he slipped back in.
“ That whale is sure talkative, thank god it slipped back in the water.”
Around 5 minutes later, another whale came to the surface to take a breath of air. He stopped dead in its tracks as soon as it saw a bald man with a white lab coat with orange blotches everywhere.
“Who are you?” the whale said in a scared tone.
“I am uh,um Max. A person who takes care of animals,” he replied. Building up confidence, he coaxed “I have some food for you! Come into this tank!”
“Well this ‘Max’ isn’t that bad, reasoned the whale,”besides, I’m really hungry”
So the whale went into the tank.
“HA! I’VE GOT YOU!” Zinker hollard!
“What have I gotten myself into?” the whale quietly whined.
“Ha Ha Ha, I guess it’s time to go home.” declared the mad scientist 
Back on mount everest. The mad scientist smugly examined the whale. He then put the whale in a different tank. Now Zinker must travel to Uniland to get the rare unicorns. He got his unicorn net, the bait (candy), and his uni-plane, for uniland is in the clouds. 1 hour later he is ready to go, for he is really messy and forgot where he put the unicorn net.
It was a windy day. When Zinker finally reached uniland, he was exhausted from all the air currents. But he still persevered. Pretty good for a mad scientist. Anyway it would be hard to catch a unicorn because they are nearly extinct. It’s also hard because every time Zinker put the bait on the cloud, it kept on falling through. The only reason he's not falling is because he’s on his plane. The plane floats, so it’s not falling. Eventually, Zinker thought of putting the candy in the cage and lying down on the plane. When the unicorn sticks its head to eat the candy, Zinker would use the net and push him in the cage. Now the trap is set.
Unlike the whales, the perfect unicorn came the first time. It was really simple. The unicorn almost got in by itself, then the mad scientist just pushed it in with the net. Simple. After helping himself to some of the leftover candy, he flew back to Mount Everest. The wind currents were wearing, so it took him around 30 minutes. When he got back he was able to start his machine.
Back on Mount Everest, Zinker prepared to start making his machine. He attached 2 metal boxes to a wire and the wires attached to a bigger metal box and a humongous hamster wheel. The energy source came from Zuper. This is how it works. The smaller boxes would hold the unicorn and whale. Then Zuper would run on the hamster wheel. That would generate power to mix their ”spirits” so they would combine to form a “Not-Whale” as the mad scientist calls it. Now everything is ready, just one more thing…
“Metals and wires, screws and nails,” boomed Zinker ``welcome to my unicorn and whale combo. So it began. Zuper started running, wires started to flow with energy, and BOOM! It was ready. Zinker cautiously approached the big box. He opened the door and Voila! Standing on its tail is a greyish blue whale with dark grey spots on its back and tiny fins and eyes. The best part was probably a unicorn horn on its head.  “Finally! My first successful creation this year!” he exclaimed,”now, what should I call it? Not Whale, Norwhal,Nawhale, NARWHAL! THat’s what I'll name it! Now, to make more!
He made multiple trips to Lunk sea and Uniland until there were no unicorns left! The set all the narwhals free, each with a tag on its horn saying “32nd creation. From Zinker” His signature tag.</p>
